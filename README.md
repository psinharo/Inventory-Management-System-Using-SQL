This Project proposes an inventory management system for the University Campus Store that will help streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction as deliverables:
1.	Accurate Inventory Tracking: This inventory management system allows for accurate tracking of inventory levels in real-time, which helps to prevent stockouts and overstocking. This ensures that the store always has the right products in stock and improves customer satisfaction.
2.	Reduced Costs: An inventory management system that can help reduce costs by optimizing inventory levels, reducing excess inventory, and preventing overstocking. This can lead to a reduction in storage and handling costs, as well as a reduction in inventory carrying costs.
3.	Automated Processes: Our inventory management system shall automate many of the manual processes involved in inventory management, such as purchase order creation, receipt of goods, and stock level updates. This saves time and reduces the risk of errors, improving operational efficiency.
4.	Customizable Reporting and Analytics: This inventory management system provides customizable reporting and analytics that allow store managers to make data-driven decisions about inventory management. This can help identify trends, forecast demand, and optimize inventory levels.
